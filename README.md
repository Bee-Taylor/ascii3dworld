# ascii3dworld
A very basic piece of software for making and maintaining a single 3d scene programmed in haskell
Currently this only has the ability to manually add faces to a world and use vector calculations to determine when a vector hits a face etc.
Eventually this should allow for a user to have the scene outputted visually as ASCII Art
It will also allow for the user to have the objects in the scene move with matrix multiplication etc.
